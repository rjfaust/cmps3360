Course Communication Policy

We will primarily use Slack and Canvas for course communication. We will use Slack primarily as a forum for students to ask questions and to facilitate discussion.  Note, Slack is not FERPA compliant, so email instructors directly if the subject is personal/sensitive. A link for an automatic invite to the class slack in on the canvas homepage.  Course announcements will be posted both in Slack and Canvas. All assignments will be posted in Canvas. Finally, students may also email us with private or sensitive matters.




Communication policies:

We will attempt to reply to all emails and slack posts within 24 hours of receiving them (48 on weekends and holidays). If you submit a question less 24 than hours before an assignment is due, you risk not getting an answer before the deadline.
Subsequently, we expect you all to check your email/slack every 24 hours as well. We encourage students to engage in slack discussions and respond to their classmates questions.
We are all available to have drop in office hours and are available by appointment. Please reach out to us directly to setup extra time if you need more support during the semester.
If you have a general question, please check or post on slack! We will check it regularly to answer common questions on coursework. The solution to your question might already be there!




Catalog/Course description

An introduction on how graphical representations of data can be used to aid understanding. This course details the theory and practice of designing effective information visualizations. The techniques learned in this class have wide applications to all fields in engineering and science, where due to increasing sizes and complexity, data now demands effective presentation and analysis. This course will cover the principles, methods, and techniques that are fundamental to information visualization.  




Course Goals

This course will roughly be broken into three distinct aspects of visualization: mechanics, principles, and techniques.




The mechanics of visualization include the low-level tools needed to implement interactive visualizations. In this course, you will learn how to build web-based interactive visualizations using some of the most popular visualization libraries and tools. You will primarily learn to use HTML5, Javascript, and D3 but will be introduced to additional tools including Tableau, Vega-lite, and Observable,




The principles of visualization cover the core considerations for designing effective visualizations. You will learn about perceptual psychology and how it constrains the ways we design algorithms for displaying data effectively and efficiently.  These constraints couple with a collection of principles governing the design process, including abstracting, encoding, and interacting with data.




The techniques describe methods created for displaying data effectively and the fundamental algorithms behind them.  You will learn several visualization techniques for various types of data, including scatterplots, histograms, heatmaps, treemaps, dimension reduction and more.




Course Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students will be able to…

Understand and apply the principles and theories of data visualization.
Design effective visualizations for a given data, task and user.
Critically evaluate visualizations and identify improvements/refinements.
Create interactive visualizations using a popular visualization library, D3.

 

Required and Suggested Student Resources




The required textbook for this course is:

Visualization Analysis and Design, Tamara Munzner, CRC Press (2014).




We will follow this book closely throughout the semester, with readings from it most weeks. There will be additional readings assigned throughout the semester, however I will make sure they can be accessed for free online or through library resources.




Recommended Resources:

Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, Scotty Murray, O’Reilly (2017)
Free on-campus online version





Other Good Resources:

Information Visualization: Perception for Design, Colin Ware, 2019
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Edward Tufte, 1983




Evaluation Procedures and Grading Criteria

This course will consist of four distinct grading areas for undergrads and 5 for graduate students. The weighting of each area as a percentage of the total grade are provided. All assignments and due dates are posted in Tulane Canvas.

Final Grade Policy

The weighted average will determine your letter grade roughly as follows, +/- grades will be given for borderline cases.

A >= 90%
B >= 80%
C >= 70%
D >= 60%
F < 60%







Course Engagement

Course engagement accounts for 10% of your course grade. Course engagement is broken down into two equal portions: 1) in-class activities and participation and 2) design critiques. Throughout the semester we will regularly complete in-class activities, such as brainstorming and think-pair-share. Participation in these activities contributes to the first portion of your engagement grade.




Additionally, you will each conduct a critique of a visualization design “in the wild” (e.g. from a news source) and participate in online discussion of your classmates critiques. Each week, starting around week 6, several students (~4) will be selected to submit their critique and all other students are required to participate in the discussion of at least one critique. The goal of this exercise is to apply your knowledge of visualization fundamentals to critically reflect on the design of public facing visualizations. 

 

Homework Assignments

Throughout the semester you will complete approximately 7 assignments.  These assignments will consist of both written and programming questions. However, the best way to learn is through hands-on practice so the bulk of assignments will involve implementing visualizations. Posting solutions publicly online without the staff’s express consent is a direct violation of our academic integrity policy.

 

Late Policy:  Homework is due by 11:59 pm on their due date, unless otherwise noted. Late assignments will receive a 10% deduction per day after the due date, unless exceptional circumstances occur. This only applies to homework assignments, not the project or design critiques. Late work will not be accepted for the project or design critiques, except in the presence of exceptional circumstances. Students who cannot submit assignments due to exception circumstances are responsible for communicating with instructors to make up any missed work.  




Final Project

Graduate students will complete a visualization project using the concepts outlined in this course. Projects must be pitched and approved by the instructor by 5th week of the semester. Projects must be significant in scope to receive approval. Projects can come in one of two flavors: (1) Find and implement a technique from an IEEE VIS or EuroVIS paper from the past 5 years or (2) Design and develop an interactive visualization tool for data in your field of expertise.




Exams

There will be two exams, one midterm in week 8 and a final exam.  Both exams will be written, closed book, open note, and in class. You will only be allowed to use your hand-written notes or printed notes, typed by yourself. Printouts of the slides, the textbook or any other resource written by someone else will not be permitted.

 

Attendance Statement

Students are required to attend all classes unless they are ill or prevented from attending due to exceptional circumstances. While lecture slides will be available online, recorded lectures and the discussions around in-class activities will not. Students who do not attend class will miss valuable content that will not be available outside of lecture. Students are responsible for informing instructors of illnesses, injuries and exception personal circumstances and providing valid documentation/notes as requested. Students who are frequently absent from class will be reported and/or removed from the course according to university policy.

 

ADA/Accessibility Statement

Tulane University is committed to offering classes that are accessible. If you anticipate or encounter disability-related barriers in a course, please contact the Goldman Center for Student Accessibility to establish reasonable accommodations. If approved by Goldman, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. I will never ask for medical documentation from you to support potential accommodation needs. Goldman Center contact information: Email: goldman@tulane.edu; Phone (504) 862-8433; Website: accessibility.tulane.edu





Code of Academic Conduct

The Code of Academic Conduct applies to all undergraduate students, full-time and part-time, in Tulane University. Tulane University expects and requires behavior compatible with its high standards of scholarship. By accepting admission to the university, a student accepts its regulations (i.e., Code of Academic Conduct and Code of Student Conduct) and acknowledges the right of the university to take disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion, for conduct judged unsatisfactory or disruptive.




Unless I indicate differently on instructions, all assignments and exams are to be completed individually and without any study aid, including textbooks, class notes, or online sites. If you have any question about whether a resource is acceptable, you must ask the instructor rather than assume. 

 

Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Statement (EDI)

Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are important Tulane values that are key drivers of academic excellence in our learning environments. In our drive for academic excellence, we seek to ensure that students, faculty, and staff across diverse social identities, cultural backgrounds, and lived experiences can thrive - especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, social class, international, veterans, religious minorities, age, and any other classification protected by applicable law - see Tulane's Nondiscrimination Policy). In order to build a supportive culture and climate for every member of our community, we recognize that we each of have unique EDI strengths to share with others and that we also have areas for EDI growth, learning, and change. This EDI commitment and cultural humility helps us collectively build a university community and culture where everyone experiences belonging.




Religious accommodation policy

Per Tulane’s religious accommodation policy as stated at the bottom Tulane’s academic calendar, I will make every reasonable effort to ensure that students are able to observe religious holidays without jeopardizing their ability to fulfill their academic obligations. Excused absences do not relieve the student from the responsibility for any course work required during the period of absence. Students should notify me within the first two weeks of the semester about their intent to observe any holidays that fall on a class day or on the day of the final exam.
