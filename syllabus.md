## Catalog/Course description

An introduction on how graphical representations of data can be used to aid understanding. This course details the theory and practice of designing effective information visualizations. The techniques learned in this class have wide applications to all fields in engineering and science, where due to increasing sizes and complexity, data now demands effective presentation and analysis. This course will cover the principles, methods, and techniques that are fundamental to information visualization.  

**Prerequisite:** CMPS 1600 Intro to Computer Science II

**Note:** While the course only assumes introductory programming knowledge, the assignments will require extensive programming in JavaScript. The course will provide introductory guidance on programming in JavaScript, such as basic syntax and control structures, but students may need to self-teach additional JavaScript concepts as needed.   

# Course Goals

This course will roughly be broken into three distinct aspects of visualization: mechanics, principles, and techniques.




The mechanics of visualization include the low-level tools needed to implement interactive visualizations. In this course, you will learn how to build web-based interactive visualizations using some of the most popular visualization libraries and tools. You will primarily learn to use HTML5, Javascript, and D3.




The principles of visualization cover the core considerations for designing effective visualizations. You will learn about perceptual psychology and how it constrains the ways we design algorithms for displaying data effectively and efficiently.  These constraints couple with a collection of principles governing the design process, including abstracting, encoding, and interacting with data.




The techniques describe methods created for displaying data effectively and the fundamental algorithms behind them.  You will learn several visualization techniques for various types of data, including scatterplots, histograms, heatmaps, treemaps, dimension reduction and more.




# Course Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students will be able to…

* Apply the principles and theories of data visualization to create expressive, accurate and understandable visualizations. 
* Design effective visualizations for a given data, task and user.
* Critically evaluate visualizations to identify limiations and biases as well as suggest improvements/refinements.
* Implement interactive visualizations using a popular visualization library, D3.

### In Class Activites, Participation and Attendence

At least once per week we will have a group, in-class activity. Students will be split into groups to work on the activity for 15-20 minutes, and share with the class for another 5-10, depending on the activity. Groups will generally brainstorm and record their in-class responses to the activites in a Google Doc in the course drive. After class, students will be required to submit their final responses **individually** on Canvas. These activities will largely be graded for completeness, provided that students made an effort in their responses. 

2/5/25 Update: Students must be present in class to receive full credit for in-class activities. However, students absent from class who still complete the activities within the submission window and whose submissions demonstrate sufficient engagement with the content, can receive credit with a 15% penalty. This penalty is applied in addition to any late penalties. 

Additionally, attendence will be recorded through TopHat. It will be taken at the start of class and will close after approximately 10 minutes. Students who attend class and participate will receive credit for the class. Attendance alone does not guarantee credit for a class. Students who are disruptive, late, unwilling to participate, and/or distracted by their devices may not receive credit for the class. Students will be allowed 3 unexcused absences, no questions asked. Beyond that, absences will only be excused for exceptional circumstances, with appropriate documentation. 

### Quizzes
Each week students will be given a short quiz to review the weeks material, ahead of the lab session on Friday. These quizzes must be completed by Thursday, 11:59pm each week. The material for these quizzes includes the weeks lecture, as well as the lab for that week. This means that students should read the labs prior to completing the quiz. 

### Labs 

Every Friday in class will be interactive lab time. In class you will have the opportunity to work on the Labs with the instructor and TAs. On these days it will be important to bring a laptop to class to participate in the work.  Labs will be worth 10 points each and graded based the rubric in Canvas.

Throughout the semester you will complete approximately 12 labs.  These labs will consist of both written and programming questions. However, the best way to learn is through hands-on practice so the bulk of labs will involve implementing visualizations. Posting solutions publicly online without the staff’s express consent is a direct violation of our academic integrity policy. **Posting solutions publicly online without the staff's express consent is a direct violation of our academic integrity policy. Late assignments will not be accepted.**
 

### Exams

There will be two exams, one midterm in week 9 (03/14) and a final exam (05/04).  Both exams will be written, closed book, and in class. You will be allowed one sheet, front and back of hand-written notes or printed notes, typed by yourself. Printouts of the slides, the textbook or any other resource written by someone else will not be permitted. You will be required to turn in this cheat sheet **with** the actual exam for credit. 


### Final Graduate Project

Graduate students will complete a visualization project using the concepts outlined in this course. Projects must be pitched and approved by the instructor by 5th week of the semester. Projects must be significant in scope to receive approval. Projects can come in one of two flavors: (1) Find and implement a technique from an IEEE VIS or EuroVIS paper from the past 5 years or (2) Design and develop an interactive visualization tool for data in your field of expertise (for non-CS majors only). More information on the project can be found on the [Project page](https://rjfaust.github.io/cmps3360/project) of the course website. 


### Final Grade Policy

The weighted average will determine your letter grade roughly as follows, +/- grades will be given for borderline cases.

A >= 90%
B >= 80%
C >= 70%
D >= 60%
F < 60%

**All grades will be posted on [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) throughout the semester.**



## Policies Related to Turning in Work

* All work will be turned in on [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/).  All work will either be distributed via [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) or in the case of Labs and examples, via the [CMPS 3360 Observable]().  
* All work will be due **11:59pm the day assigned**, unless otherwise noted.
* Update 2/5: Labs will be completed on Observable but submitted through Canvas. Students must give Observable notebooks the proper permissions for the instructor and TAs to view them.  Labs that are submitted within the submission window but lack the necessary permissions for the instructors and TAs to view them will initially receive a zero. Once grades are released, students have two days to correct the permissions and notify the instructors/TAs to request a re-grade. After two days, the zero will become permanent. 

 
### Late Work Policy
The cutoff for on-time submssion is 11:59pm on the due date. Late days are counted in 24-hour periods. Submitting between 12:00am and 11:59pm the next day is one day late.  


Below, is the high level summary of the late policy :
+ Students will be given 3 grace days for late **labs**. Extensions will not be given for quizzes and in-class activities. 
+ A late penalty of 10% per day for quizzes, labs, and in-class activities.
+ There is a hard deadline for all assignments, 2 days after the due date. 
+ Late work will not be accepted for the graduate project. 


#### Grace Days for Labs
Students will be given 3 "grace days" for **labs only** where they can choose to give themselves extra time, **up to 2 days**, without penalty. After 2 days, late work will **recieve a zero.** 

Each grace day is equivalent to one 24-hour period and students may use up to 2 grace days on any one assignment. **Grace days are intended to cover real problems: illness, broken laptops, etc.** Though we won't check on how students use them, if students run out of grace days before a real problem occurs, they may not be able to acquire an extension. 

Instructor-granted extensions are only considered for labs after all grace days are used, or if students require an extension greater than two days,  and only given in exceptional situations. If students have grace days remaining, the instructor will not grant an extension. When asking for an instructor-granted extension, students will be required to make a compelling case, with documentation where appropriate, as to why they need an additional extension. We require this to maintain fairness to other students who work hard to preserve their grace days for true emergencies. 
Students should **never** assume an extension and should always promptly communicate their circumstances with the instructor. 

Extensions will not be given for quizzes and in-class activities. 

#### Late work Penalty

The penalty for late work is 10% per day late, up to two days. This penalty applies to labs, quizzes, and in-class activities.  However, for labs, this only applies after students have run out of grace days. 
**After two days, the assignment will recieve a zero**.


#### Hard deadline
All coursework will have a hard deadline 2 Days after the original due date. This applies regardless of how many grace days students have left. 
That means that, even if a student has 3 grace days left, late work will **not** be accepted 3 days late. 

#### Graduate Project
Finally, no late work will be accepted for the graduate project. Graduate students **must** meet milestone deadlines unless they have prior authorization from the intstructor to submit late. 
 

<!-- Late Policy:  Homework is due by 11:59 pm on their due date, unless otherwise noted. Late assignments will receive a 10% deduction per day after the due date, unless exceptional circumstances occur. This only applies to homework assignments, not the project or design critiques. Late work will not be accepted for the project or design critiques, except in the presence of exceptional circumstances. Students who cannot submit assignments due to exception circumstances are responsible for communicating with instructors to make up any missed work.   -->

---

## Schedule and Workload

See the [Schedule Page](./schedule.md) for the schedule and assignments.

This is an upper division computer science course, there will be a lot of work. Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).  

If you need help please check the [discussion board on Canvas!](https://tulane.instructure.com/). We check it regularly to answer common questions on projects and homeworks.  The solution to your question might already be there!

Students are reminded to make use of office hours.  Please reach out to any of the course staff whenever you need and we can make appointments to meet if you require it.

## Attendance Statement

**Students are required to attend all classes unless they are ill or prevented from attending due to exceptional circumstances.** While lecture slides will be available online, recorded lectures and the discussions around in-class activities will not. Students who do not attend class will miss valuable content that will not be available outside of lecture. Students are responsible for informing instructors of illnesses, injuries and exception personal circumstances and providing valid documentation/notes as requested. **Students who are frequently absent from class will be reported and/or removed from the course according to university policy.**

## Other Course and Tulane Policies

### Use of Electronic Devices

Please silence your cellphones during class.  If you want to use a laptop or other device with a large screen for note taking please sit in the back rows of the classroom -- it’s distracting to other students [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-are-better-off-without-a-laptop-in-the-classroom/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-are-better-off-without-a-laptop-in-the-classroom/)

**Note:** For in-class activities and lab sessions, students will often need to bring their laptop to class to work on the labs and engage with the class for the day.

### Student Support Services

Please come talk to us if you feel you are behind or overwhelmed in this class.  We can work with you and Tulane provides a suite of services to help you succeed in this course including the following.  For more information please visit the [student support services webpage](https://studentaffairs.tulane.edu/).

* Academic Advising - Advising maximizes student potential by sharing information, tools, and resources that empower them to make informed decisions about creating appropriate plans to achieve their academic goals. 
* Academic Learning & Tutoring - The ALTC supports students through supplemental instruction, peer tutoring, writing and presentation consultations, pop-up review sessions, study space, and online learning resources. 
* Case Management and Counseling - Students can leverage support services such as [CAPS for Counseling Services](https://campushealth.tulane.edu/caps), [Case Management and Victim Support Services](https://cmvss.tulane.edu/), and [Goldman Center for Student Accessibility](https://accessibility.tulane.edu/).
* Success Coaching - Coaches help students create actionable steps to meet goals on topics such as college transition, time-management, motivation, testing anxiety, stress management, and decision-making.

### ADA/Accessibility Statement

Tulane University is committed to offering classes that are accessible. If you anticipate or encounter disability-related barriers in a course, please contact the Goldman Center for Student Accessibility to establish reasonable accommodations. If approved by Goldman, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. I will never ask for medical documentation from you to support potential accommodation needs. Goldman Center contact information: Email: goldman@tulane.edu; Phone (504) 862-8433; Website: accessibility.tulane.edu





### Code of Academic Conduct

The Code of Academic Conduct applies to all students, full-time and part-time, in Tulane University. Tulane University expects and requires behavior compatible with its high standards of scholarship. By accepting admission to the university, a student accepts its regulations (i.e., Code of Academic Conduct and Code of Student Conduct) and acknowledges the right of the university to take disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion, for conduct judged unsatisfactory or disruptive.

While discussion between peers is encouraged, unless otherwise indicated, students must submit their own work. Students may **not** read or copy a classmates solution or copy solutions from the web - this includes AI generated solutions. **We will be running checks on the code turned in for plagiarism.  If plagiarism is detected the minimum penalty is a 0 on the assignment and being reported, however, you may automatically fail this course at the discretion of the instructor or Honor Board.**

For more information about the honor board process and the code of academic conduct please see the [NTC Academic Integrity Website](https://college.tulane.edu/academics/academic-integrity).

It is important to recognize the distinction between cheating and cooperation. Students are encouraged to help each other understand concepts in a high-level discussion, as well as seek online resources to further understanding of course materials. However, all submitted assignments must be in the students own words and based on their understanding of the material. Copying answers from a peer or the internet - including AI generated answers, or having a peer dicate answers, is cheating. Letting a peer copy answers is cheating. 

<!-- 
Unless I indicate differently on instructions, all assignments and exams are to be completed individually and without any study aid, including textbooks, class notes, or online sites. If you have any question about whether a resource is acceptable, you must ask the instructor rather than assume.  -->

 

### Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Statement (EDI)

Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are important [Tulane values](https://tulane.edu/core-values) that are key drivers of academic excellence in our learning environments. In our drive for academic excellence, we seek to ensure that students, faculty, and staff across diverse social identities, cultural backgrounds, and lived experiences can thrive - especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, social class, international, veterans, religious minorities, age, and any other classification protected by applicable law - see [Tulane's Nondiscrimination Policy](https://hr.tulane.edu/institutional-equity)). In order to build a supportive culture and climate for every member of our community, we recognize that we each of have unique EDI strengths to share with others and that we also have areas for EDI growth, learning, and change. This EDI commitment and cultural humility helps us collectively build a university community and culture where everyone experiences belonging.




### Religious accommodation policy

Per Tulane’s religious accommodation policy as stated at the bottom [Tulane’s academic calendar](https://registrar.tulane.edu/Academic_Calendar), I will make every reasonable effort to ensure that students are able to observe religious holidays without jeopardizing their ability to fulfill their academic obligations. Excused absences do not relieve the student from the responsibility for any course work required during the period of absence. Students should notify me within the first two weeks of the semester about their intent to observe any holidays that fall on a class day or on the day of the final exam.

 

### Title IX:

Tulane University recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals and promotes respect for all people. As such, Tulane is committed to providing an environment free of all forms of discrimination including sexual and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence like sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or is experiencing these types of behaviors, know that you are not alone. Resources and support are available: you can learn more at [http://allin.tulane.edu](https://allin.tulane.edu/). 



### Disclosures of gender-based discrimination 

In order to comply with the requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Tulane University requires all faculty members to report incidents of gender-based discrimination. Please know that if you choose to confide in me, I am required by the university to share your disclosure in a Care Connection to the Office of Case Management and Victim Support Services to be sure you are connected with all the support the university can offer.  The Title IX Coordinator is also notified of these disclosures.  You choose whether or not you want to meet with these offices. You can also make a disclosure yourself, including an anonymous report, through the form at [http://tulane.edu/concerns](http://tulane.edu/concerns). 

 

### Statement on Confidentiality and Privacy

### Title IX Safeguards for Pregnant and Parenting Students  

Title IX also provides reasonable protections and support for pregnant and parenting students.  Discrimination on the basis of a student’s pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of the previous conditions is prohibited by Title IX, and Tulane is committed to providing equal access to academic programs and extracurricular activities to students who might be, are, or have been pregnant.  If you need support related to a pregnancy or any of the previously listed conditions, visit pregnancy.tulane.edu for more information, including a list of resources. Student who believe that they may have experienced pregnancy discrimination can file a complaint with the Title IX Office by contacting 504-865-5611 or titleix@tulane.edu, visiting the office in Jones Hall 308, or filing a report at tulane.edu/concerns.
